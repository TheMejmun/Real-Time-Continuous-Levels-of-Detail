# Real-Time Continuous Levels of Detail

## Setup

This project requires a valid [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/tools#download-these-essential-development-tools) installation and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) to be compilable. It has been tested working on Windows (x64) and MacOS (arm64). 

## Warning

While this project started out as being very organized and designed to be highly scalable, due to the nature of university projects and deadlines, the last sprint to the finish line has left it in a suboptimal state in terms of code cleanliness. You have been warned. I do intend to work on this.
